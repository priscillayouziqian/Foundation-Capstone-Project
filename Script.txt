Hi everyone, my name is Zhaoyi Yan. And this is my foundation capstone project.
Welcome to Brithday Deals. This is an application I created because I'll miss good
birthday deals if I don't check my emails often. 

So I created a site where all users could come together, share deals they found. 

For this project, I use JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML template, CSS, express and axios.
What you are at now, is the home page. 

On the top, you can select types by clicking submit button. The page is interactive, 
feel free to mouse over the picture of any
post, you'll get a bigger version of the picture. And Clicking detail button to
view details. Or feel free to clik the picture which will direct you
to the vendor's webpage in a new tap for further details.If you find the post is 
not up-to-date, you can click the delete button
on the upper right of the post.

Let's head to the how it works page by clicking menu bar on the left. Here is
an introduction for new users. You can simply click header on top which brings 
you back to the home page.

Let's create a new post~ Lets say you find a deal of Subway, add image, title,
deal details, Subway's link, and select a type. Hit submit. And you'll automatically
back to the home page. And look! Your Subway post is on the first column. 


That's it for the demostration. Birthday Deals is a fun website to create. 
Wish you have a wonderful birthday with this useful application!
