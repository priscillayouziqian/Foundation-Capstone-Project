# Foundation-Capstone-Project

The purpose of the project is to build a collection application for various birthday deals from start to finish. Welcome to Birthday Deals. I created it because I'll miss good birthday deals if I don't check my emails often.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML template, CSS, express and Axios

(1) Selecting type & submit, proceed a get request, where I dynamically created HTML from JavaScript.

Click delete button on upper right to delete the post.

(5) Create a post request to the database.
On New post page, create a post by adding information it needs & submit             |  It automatically brings you back to home page. New post is in the first column

## Optimizations
It will be great if more features added, like update an existing post. In that case, a new page for each post might need to create, so that users can update info in that page.

## Lessons Learned:
Gain experience for building a full stack application, follows important steps:<br>
wireframe, major features, front end, server and database. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:<br><br>
